Hi, Iâ€™m a passionate learner exploring web development and building small projects to strengthen my skills. This Color Flipper project is part of my practice in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It helps me understand DOM manipulation, event handling, and user interaction in a fun and creative way. I enjoy experimenting with simple ideas and turning them into interactive projects that can be shared and improved over time.
